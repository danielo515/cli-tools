> Your one stop dependency for node-js command line tools creation

This package is a collection of common utilities to build command line tools on NodeJS. It is indeed opinionated and arises from my experience building this kind of tools.
Adding this library as the only dependency of your command-line utility should provide you with all the required tools to deliver something amazing.

The following libraries are included

* lodash   - because you are going to write code you will need tools, and there is no better swish army knife than lodash
* chalk    - the defacto standard for coloring the console
* figlet   - your command line will be nothing without a cool banner (branding is important!)
* inquirer - create a wizard to make questions to your users interactively
